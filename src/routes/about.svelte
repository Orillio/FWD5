                    Can make a simple layout with the right structure, and create a backend with extensible architecture. Excellent understanding of OOP (I can explain the difference between abstract class and interface).
                    I know a lot of patterns, SOLID principles and know how to use them in the right places. I know a lot of algorithms and data structures, how to implement them and how to estimate the complexity of algorithms. 
                    I have some experience in Django API deployment using Docker.
